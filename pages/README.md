Here I make my workbook to stubdy JavaScript and little NuxtJS. 

Fisrt of all I make pages for test main objects (string, array, node, document, window, canvas and others). 

In "Array methods" I realized JSON with name methods, description and example function. For use example functions from JSON I applied eval() - this function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.
