      <p class="lead"> Here I used NuxtJS, Argon, Highlightjs. <strong><b>NuxtJS</b></strong> -- becouse <cite>"is a higher-level framework built on top of the Vue ecosystem which provides an extremely streamlined development experience for writing universal Vue applications."</cite>. <strong><b>Argon</b></strong> - this is design system based on Bootstrap 4. I decided to try "Argon" because a month before the creation of this "conspectus", I saw the order on the freelance to make the site on this template. <strong><b>HighlightJS</b></strong> -  is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript. It works in the browser as well as on the server. It works with pretty much any markup, doesnâ€™t depend on any framework, and has automatic language detection. </p>

I\'ve found a wonderful component in the wilderness Internet, who\'s a good at this task. But there was a problem with children\'s transitions. The "parent" transition should be calculated taking heights of the "children". Which means, that at the moment when the "show" button is pressed, "children" should be in the position "v-if=true". I made a function that was launched by clicking on this button "show". It switch the "children" into "v-if=false", and after half the time transition "parent", it returned back into "v-if=true". So, before finished animation drops the bottom border in parent -- "children" changed v-if in true-false-true, which started their "transition" (Probably, better one time see code this function, which called "zapusk")</p><p class="lead">There are 3 transitions for "children": to the <strong><b>text-description, to code-example, to result-code</b></strong>.
