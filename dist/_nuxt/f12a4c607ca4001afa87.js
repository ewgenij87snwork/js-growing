I found a wonderful component on the Internet, which is good done this task. But there was a problem with children\'s transitions. The "parent" transition should be calculated taking  sizes of the "children". That is, at the moment when the "show" button is pressed, "children" should be in the position "v-if=true". I made a function that was launched by clicking on this button "show". It translated the "children" into "v-if=false", and half the time later, while the "parent" animation was going on, it returned "v-if=true" to them. That is, before finished animation drops the bottom border in parent -- "children" changed v-if in true-false-true, which started their "transition" (Probably, better one time see code this function, which called "zapusk")</p><p class="lead">There are 3 transitions for "children": to the <strong><b>text-description, to code-example, to result-code</b></strong>.
